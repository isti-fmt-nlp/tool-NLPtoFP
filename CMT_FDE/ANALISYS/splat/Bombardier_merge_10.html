CITYFLO 450/650 are emerging as the leading technologies, which were recently selected as the preferred train control in major systems such as the Neihu Rapid Transit system in Taiwan, the Yong-In LRT system in South Korea and Madrid Metro s Lines 1 and 6 in Spain.
The paper elaborates on specific concepts / definitions that are applied to the moving block CBTC technology and will explain the architecture of the CITYFLO 450/650 systems emphasising the approach taken while conceptualising the design of these systems.
The paper also describes some of the special features that make these solutions first in their class.
The paper also discusses the methodology used to satisfy the overlay approach where the operator demands the implementation of a CBTC system on an existing operational or brownfield system, without affecting existing operations.
It specifically addresses the interesting application of CITYFLO 650 for the Neihu-Muzha lines in Taiwan, which has the unique characteristics of being both greenfield and brownfield with an existing 12-km line and the new 15-km extension, as well as featuring both new and existing rolling stock.
The paper describes the Bombardier approach and strategy to achieve implementation with such challenging requirements.
1 INTRODUCTION Due to numerous reasons, some of which relate to environmental concerns, cost of fuel, road congestion, and the need for efficient and effective mass transit systems, the railway industry has a significant and more predominant role in today s modern society.
Transit authorities are turning to the rail industry to provide a more efficient way to transport people with higher reliability at a lower cost.
One fundamental element of rail transportation is the train control system.
The signalling and train control products are among the components that contribute most to the enhanced performance of the railways.
The signalling industry has responded to the market requirements and many suppliers have structured their signalling products to ensure that their systems can migrate effectively throughout the wide span of customer s requirements.
Bombardier Transportation has emerged as one of the leading suppliers of Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) systems.
With the range of Bombardier CITYFLO products, Bombardier has the technology to address all mass transit requirements for rail control.
The CITYFLO solutions have been implemented around the world and offer reliable, state-of-the-art technologies that provide increased efficiency and performance.

3.1 CITYFLO System Architecture Like most modern train control systems, the CITYFLO 650 ATC is divided into various subsystems, based upon function and modular hardware and software.
The following figure illustrates the Train Control System Architecture for a typical metro installation.
Figure 2: CITYFLO 650 System Architecture The Central Control subsystem is interconnected via the Central Control Network connecting the various control operator workstations.
The operators supervise their respective systems from within the Central Control Network.
The Central Control Network provides the ATS functionality, and is connected to the Wayside Network.
The Wayside Network connects the Region ATP, Region ATO, and remote Region ATP computer systems.
These sub-systems are responsible for the safe and optimal performance of the train control system.
Information flows between these sub-systems through the Wayside Network backbone and through to the Central Control Network.
A Base Data Radio (BDR) equipment connected to each RATP communicates with the vehicles via the leaky coaxial antenna (RADIAX) or Line of Sight (LOS) Radio system.
Train control data is exchanged between the wayside and train-borne systems through this link more commonly referred to as the Train to Wayside Communication (TWC) link.
This communication is achieved via a 2.4GHz Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) radio.
The RATP is responsible for formatting all data to be transmitted to the trains.
It receives information from the Central Control through the Region ATO, and transmits that data along with data of its own to the trains.
The TWC equipment includes leaky coaxial cable, the BDRs, Distribution Amplifiers; and onboard, the Mobile Antennas and the Mobile Data Radio (MDR).
Data is transferred through the MDR to and from the Vehicle ATP (VATP).
The VATP is responsible for the safe operation of the train including safe train movement and occupancy generation.
The Vehicle ATO (VATO) is responsible for speed control including jerk limitation, stopping accuracy, door control and implementation of speed and brake profiles selected by the ATS.
3.2 Train Registry System (TRS) In traditional CBTC systems, at cold start-up or after a complete shut-down due to failure, the initialisation process entails a complete manual sweep of the entire region to clear the blocked segments .
The sweeping is usually performed by technicians by driving the trains manually through all segments in the region.
This is a very time consuming process and can take a few hours for a large metro before restoring the operation.
This is considered as a major weakness in the CBTC systems.
The TRS within the CITYFLO 650 is a patented secondary recovery system that is capable of tracking the trains separately.
The TRS comprises an independent vital computer that maintains record of all trains operating within a certain predefined area.
This information is communicated to the Automatic Train Protection (ATP), which then polls and established communication with all of the trains in the system.
This obviates the need for any manual sweeping and the auto operation can be resumed within a very short time, usually a few minutes 4 CBTC OVERLAY ON EXISTING SYSTEMS One major challenge in moving towards full automation is having the ability to overlay the train control system onto an operational railway without interrupting the revenue service.
The overlay consideration is desirable when considering to replace or upgrade the signalling system on a network already in full operation.
With a CBTC system, overlay onto an existing system becomes feasible without affecting the existing operations due to the following: o The small amount of ground-based equipment required for a CBTC system installation ensures that there will be minimal disruptions to revenue service.
IRSE Technical Convention Singapore Page 2 of 6 24 to 26 October 2005 Rajendra Jadhav Bombardier CBTC Solutions Bombardier Transportation o In CBTC systems, the ground-based components include passive norming points (that have no hardwired connections) and the radio system that allow installation and testing with no service disruptions.
The CBTC systems are ideal for overlaying new signalling on existing operational lines.
The CITYFLO CBTC systems, which have the capability to operate either with a radio frequency (RF) radiating cable (RADIAX) or using RF line of sight, have already been overlaid onto the existing systems at the Seattle-Tacoma Airport and the South Eastern Pennsylvania Transit Authority (SEPTA).
Bombardier is also in the process of overlaying its CITYFLO 650 on the Muzha Line in Taipei, as well as its CITYFLO 450 on the Madrid Metro Lines 1 and 6.
A typical overlay project separates the work into different components to reduce the risks and prepare a systematic cutover.
The first step normally addresses the wayside elements.
The wayside infrastructure, such as norming points, and the various radio elements are designed and installed first.
The work continues with the implementation of the regional Automatic Train Protection (ATP), as well as the Automatic Train Operation (ATO) systems.
Typically, in a simultaneous approach, we would consider the design and installation of the underlaying interlocking system, and the design and installation of the Vehicle On-board Automatic Train Control (VATC).
In Section 5, the equipped versus non-equipped train operation is further addressed.
The on-board system, depending on the agreed cut-over plan, may see a dual installation in certain cases that allows dual mode, also called mixed-mode operation.
Excellent examples of mixed-mode operation are the Madrid Line 1 and Line 6 projects.
Should the elements such as track switches, track signal, station doors, etc.
need to be replaced, the work can be done incrementally.
The next step includes the installation of the Central Control equipment.
The ability to switch to and from the new equipment is critical for an effective and seamless testing program.
Of course the work involved in an overlay project varies greatly from one system to another to accommodate the operation needs.
The system itself also imposes some restrictions as to how the work can be accomplished.
4.1 The Neihu-Muzha Line Project Bombardier is currently implementing the Neihu extension to the existing Muzha line in Taipei.
The plan is to overlay the Neihu Line CITYFLO 650 CBTC technology onto the existing Muzha Line, in order to achieve a seamless integration onto the Muzha line.
The design, systems engineering/integration, and delivery of a driverless system are complex undertakings in a greenfield environment, and much more so in a brownfield environment.
The Neihu/Muzha project brings both elements into one project.
The Department of Rapid Transit Systems of the Taipei City Government in Taiwan awarded a contract in mid-2003 for the extension of its existing Muzha Rapid Transit System, called the Neihu extension, and a retrofit of the existing Muzha Automated line with a new ATC system.
4.2 Neihu System Overview The Neihu portion of the project is greenfield , with new construction for the track, stations, depot, Operational Central Control (OCC) and wayside equipment.
The new line is 15 kilometres long, dual track with 12 stations, 7 interlockings, 21 switches and is divided into two ATC regions.
The Neihu depot has the primary OCC, a car wash, a test track, 33 switches, and storage for 64 trains (two married pairs per train).
A total number of 101 new vehicles will be delivered in married pair configuration with 30 delivered in Phase 1 and the remaining 71 delivered in Phase 2.
In addition, Bombardier will also deliver a new Neihu Maintenance Recovery Vehicle (MRV), and a Maintenance Vehicle.
Automatic operation includes the depot storage, the wash rack, and up to the maintenance shop.
4.3 Muzha System Overview The existing Muzha line is 11 kilometres long with 12 stations, 5 interlockings and 12 switches.
This is a Brownfield project as it is an overlay of a new ATC on an existing system.
The Muzha depot has 21 switches, storage for 42 trains, a test track, a Car Wash, and the OCC for the Muzha line, which will be replaced with a back-up OCC during Phase 3.
The current Muzha ATC is a fixed block system and was installed nearly 20 years ago.
The wayside ATC must be overlaid on the existing system without disrupting current operations, in order that the new Neihu vehicles can replace the existing fleet when they are removed later for conversion to the new ATC.
The new installation will divide the track into two regions for ATC purposes.
Both the Muzha depot and the Neihu depot are considered separate regions for the ATC, providing a total of 6 regions when Phase 2 is completed.
IRSE Technical Convention Singapore Page 3 of 6 24 to 26 October 2005 Rajendra Jadhav Bombardier CBTC Solutions Bombardier Transportation Figure 3: Neihu-Muzha Line System The Brownfield nature of this part of the project will further draw upon all the integration and planning skills developed through many years of Bombardier experience in executing overlay projects successfully on an operating system.
The program has been planned in three main phases: The first phase is the building of the new Neihu extension of the existing Muzha line, installation of the ATC equipment, including a new Central Control, and depot including maintenance and storage facilities and delivery of new vehicles.
This phase ends once the new Neihu line enters into revenue service.
At this time, the Muzha and Neihu lines will operate separately.
The second phase of the program is to join the Muzha and Neihu lines to operate as a single system.
The installation of the new CITYFLO 650 ATC system on the existing Muzha line will be completed and a cutover to the new system performed with no disruption to service.
Additional new vehicles will be delivered and the existing Muzha vehicles will be stored in Depot.
The third phase is the modification of the existing Muzha vehicles to equip them with the CITYFLO 650 and enable operation on the new CITYFLO 650 system.
The existing Muzha Central Control will be replaced with a new Central Control to allow operation of the entire Muzha/Neihu line with either Muzha or Neihu Central Control for full redundancy.
This final stage allows operation of a mixed fleet of modified existing vehicles and new Neihu vehicles.
4.4 Implementation The most challenging aspects of the project are found in the installation of the CITYFLO 650 ATC on the existing Muzha line without disruption of revenue service, and the retrofit of the existing Muzha vehicles with the CITYFLO 650 Vehicle ATC.
The project implementation has been structured to mitigate these risks.
As explained above, Phase 1 of the project will bring the new Neihu system into revenue service.
During this time, the new Neihu vehicles, including the integration of the vehicle ATC and wayside equipment will be developed and tested on the Pittsburgh test track.
Further, the overall ATC system will be developed and tested in the engineering lab and the OCC and wayside equipment set up in Pittsburgh in preparation for a total system Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) prior to shipping the equipment to Taiwan.
The FAT uses the actual hardware to be used in the new Muzha and Neihu OCCs, and the wayside ATC.
Other system elements such as communications, passenger information systems, automatic platform doors, power supply and distribution, etc.
are either in place for the FAT or represented by simulators if deemed impractical.
Following the FAT of the Neihu wayside system, the wayside equipment, OCC components and the ATC software will be shipped to the site to begin installation and integration testing, initially on the Neihu depot test track and segments of the new Neihu system that are accessible.
Installation, testing and commissioning of the wayside equipment, though complex, is fairly straightforward, with many similar installations having been accomplished by Bombardier.
A phased regimen of detailed installation, testing and commissioning will be implemented to accomplish the objectives.
The wayside equipment, already integrated and tested as a system, will undergo additional testing steps once delivered to the site.
Incremental commissioning and testing, conducted to a rigorous preengineered plan will take place in preparation for integration with the new vehicles, which have already been tested.
At the same time, work is underway to develop the vehicle interfaces to support the future conversion of the Muzha vehicles to CITYFLO 650 during Phase 3 of the project and to undertake the overlay of the wayside equipment required for the Muzha System ATC, also beginning during Phase 1.
Due to the requirement not to disrupt Muzha revenue service during the overlay, all installation and associated testing will take place during the 4-hour period each night when the system is out of service.
IRSE Technical Convention Singapore Page 4 of 6 24 to 26 October 2005 Rajendra Jadhav Bombardier CBTC Solutions Bombardier Transportation To mitigate any potential problems with this installation, a Bombardier team is on site in Taipei to provide the information and support needed to integrate the ATC and vehicle on the existing Muzha system, to integrate the ATC onto the Muzha vehicle, and to develop a step-by-step Muzha wayside cutover plan.
Time has been planned to ensure integration of the new ATC system with the existing Muzha switches, platform screen doors, and other components controlled by the existing ATC.
To simplify installation of the CITYFLO 650 in the existing Muzha depot and at crossovers, Line of Sight (LOS) radio transmission will be used in those areas, with the remainder of the system planned to be Radiax cable.
Early production Neihu vehicles will be used during the nightly downtime to commission the Muzha wayside equipment.
By the time the cutover to the CITYFLO 650 ATC and new Neihu vehicle occurs during Phase 2, the system will have been thoroughly tested and experience gained during the cutover testing and initial revenue operation of Neihu brought to bear.
These steps will mitigate the risk of the ATC cutover.
The cutover to the new CITYFLO 650 on the Muzha system will take place during Phase 2 of the project.
Phase 2 continues the delivery of the Neihu vehicles and links the Neihu and Muzha lines together with service for both provided by the new Neihu vehicles, once a sufficient fleet is available.
This also mitigates risk as the operation of the entire line is with the same ATC and vehicles used during the Phase 1 introduction of the Neihu line into revenue service.
Phase 3 of the project is the retrofit of the existing Muzha vehicles and installation of a second OCC at the Muzha depot.
The installation of the OCC is considered low risk as this is the same equipment used for the Neihu OCC.
With the vehicle integration issues undertaken early in the program, the risk of this aspect of the project is reduced significantly.
4.5 Muzha Vehicle Retrofit The integration of the new CITYFLO 650 onto the existing Muzha vehicle is a challenging project in its own right.
The vehicles were made by Matra years ago and not all the documentation is easily available.
To mitigate this risk, a Muzha vehicle will be provided to Bombardier in Taipei to for our examination and testing on the existing Muzha vehicle test track.
Testing of the vehicle s static and dynamic characteristics will be done to allow development of an interface between the CITYFLO 650 and the existing braking and propulsion control units on the Muzha vehicle.
Once this has been completed in 2005, a roll-on vehicle ATC system will be installed in the test vehicle to allow testing of this integration of vehicle and ATC.
This is planned for the later half of 2005.
Later, additional testing will be conducted using this vehicle with the CITYFLO 650 using the installed Neihu system.
Each retrofitted vehicle will be subjected to the same rigorous testing program as the new Neihu vehicles once the work is complete.
Commissioning on the test track will follow, as each vehicle is incrementally tested and qualified so it can ultimately be returned to service for unmanned operation.
These steps will help mitigate the risk of the Muzha vehicle retrofit and enable a smooth transition to Phase 3 of the project, retrofit of the Muzha vehicles and OCC and introduction to revenue service of 51 retrofitted Muzha married pairs.
Figure 4: Bombardier CBTC Test Site 5 EQUIPPED VERSUS NON-EQUIPPED In some applications, there are some requirements to track both types of vehicles those equipped with CBTC on-board systems and those either not equipped with CBTC or having no means to communicate with the system in place.
This requirement exists more specifically when different vehicles must access a CBTC line.
In such cases, the approach used is to implement a dual system where an underlaying interlocking system is installed making use of track circuits for occupancy detection.
The main challenges rest in the interface of the two systems, as well as implementing a safe detection without impacting the system performance.
IRSE Technical Convention Singapore Page 5 of 6 24 to 26 October 2005 Rajendra Jadhav Bombardier CBTC Solutions Bombardier Transportation Faced with the desire to upgrade to CBTC, some signalling engineers are advocating installation of CBTC as an overlay in order to maintain the old interlocking structures and operating methods as a fallback.
CBTC systems, due to their architecture, have the capability to overlay the new signalling systems onto existing operational lines.
However, this approach reduces the benefits of CBTC, otherwise to be gained from pure implementation.
6 CBTC AND ITS FUTURE Due to the evolution of the technology and the experienced gain in the ATC operation over the last 30 years, the modern CBTC systems are more reliable and less prone to failure compared to the older train control systems.
The CBTC systems have less wayside equipment, making them easier to implement and maintain.
The CBTC is evolving in such a way as to simplify the architecture, making use of the latest technology to offer more compact systems.
With the advent of modern electronics, it has been possible to build redundancy into the design so that failures do not impact the operational availability of the system adversely.
There are many discussions ongoing evolving the philosophy of interoperability.
These discussions are very positive and definitely influence the evolution of the ATC systems.
The fundamental motivator is having the ability to operate equipped and unequipped trains on the same system or line.
The radio component in the CBTC has evolved and is an area that is still in full evolution.
The major trend that can be observed is the use of the ISM (Industrial Scientific and Medical) frequency bands.
The 2.4 GHz band has been extensively used in conjunction with spread spectrum technology.
To safely serve as a reliable communication highway, these bands offer a larger bandwidth allowing more data to be transferred from the train to the wayside.
This allows for information outside the train control to share the same communication media.
The interoperability element can take various forms.
Having the ability to operate equipped and unequipped trains on the same line is one approach.
The increasing demand is to separate the on-board, wayside and central control and identify standard interfaces.
Tremendous efforts have been invested in this direction and only time will show the degree of feasible interoperability CONCLUSION Having the ability to run completely Unattended , the CBTC systems offer complete flexibility in terms of operational schedules / timetables, enabling the urban rail operators to respond to the specific traffic demand more swiftly and efficiently.
The studies have shown the UTO systems have a potential to improve the traffic capacity up to 50% compared to manual driving as quoted by the UITP President in a recent publication.
Some of the urban rail operators have also converted the driver function into onboard attendant to improve the customer service to their customers.
In summary, the mass transit train control systems have evolved in the past 30 years towards the Unattended and Driverless Train Operation.
The evolution of the technology has allowed the systems to be engineered in a simpler architecture, which in turn provided the possibility to upgrade numerous urban transit systems.
The advantages of the UTO systems, such as flexibility, upgradeability, reduced life-cycle cost, advantageous cost of operation and more, will motivate the transportation operators to adopt this technology.
An increasing number of mass transit operators around the world are adopting CBTC systems, when faced with rehabilitation of their current systems or extending their networks.
However, there is still a debate going on amongst many signalling engineers whether to modernize fully and create a system that provides all the operational benefits of true moving block and bidirectional communication, without the burden of excessive trackside equipment and its associated maintenance headaches, or fall back to the familiar with undue complexity.
In the next decade, it will be a challenge for all suppliers to reduce the cost, adopt the new technologies to simplify the systems, and to offer a better implementation approach in order to mitigate the risk and reduce the implementation time.

These issues are driving the need for efficient and effective mass transit systems, and the rail industry is faced with a challenge to provide a more efficient way to transport people with higher reliability at a lower cost.
One significant domain in railway transportation is the train control system.
The train control systems required to address the needs of the global mass transit market cover a wide range from basic line of sight signalling systems up to the unattended train operation system also called UTO.
The signalling and train control products are among the components that contribute most to the enhanced performance of the railways.
Over the last decade the railway industry has invested significant research and development effort to improve the train control systems, taking advantage of the technologies and innovations now available on the market.
Bombardier Transportation has invested significant efforts in streamlining the products, technologies and capability; and has structured its signalling solutions in the most comprehensive, cohesive and upgradeable product lines.
The products have been organized into two main structures: Bombardier INTERFLO for mainline solutions and Bombardier CITYFLO for urban needs.
The INTERFLO system offers complete mainline solutions individually tailored to the customer s need, encompassing integrated operations control systems and computerized interlocking systems, as well as automatic train protection and wayside equipment.
The CITYFLO system provides complete urban railway solutions for all types of mass transit such as trams, light rail vehicles and metros to suit various operating modes and customer s need.
These include cab signalling, semi-automatic train operation, driverless and unattended train operation.
The systems can be expanded to the customer s growing requirements and thus meet the operational demands for the entire life of the system.

Stover CITYFLO 650 System Overview 80 The CITYFLO 650 solution is a Communication-Based Train Control?CBTC? system that does not require track circuits or an onboard operator, making it an ideal choice for new?green field? installations.
CITYFLO 650 can also be used as an overlay train control system to upgrade existing fixed block?brown field?systems.
It can be made to support mixed-mode operation and the graceful upgrade and expansion of any metro as the wayside and vehicle equipment are systematically upgraded through a retrofit program, eventually yielding improved transport capacity, permitting higher speeds and greater regularity, reliability and utilization of the rolling stock assets.
1.1 CITYFLO 650 Design Features CITYFLO 650 is a state-of-the-art system that uses the moving block technique to manage the trains in a railway network assuring the highest level of system performance, flexibility, safety, reliability and availability.
CITYFLO 650 uses service proven components, including up to date CBTC products that have evolved from traditional ATC systems with a long service history in rail transit.
This evolution dates back to the 1970s with the fixed-block automatic train control technology provided for San Francisco s Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART).
The CITYFLO 650 ATC provides: ?Inherent bi-directional operation ?Continuous real-time data communication independent of track circuits It fulfils the requirements of a communication-based system in a transit environment, using the most advanced technology in the world.
The key features of the system are: ?Fully operational redundant configuration ?Distributed system architecture ?Reliable radio communications ?Ease of adaptation to scheme plan or track layout changes ?Automatic Restart (Train Registry System) ?CITYFLO Monitoring System (CFMS) ?Industry standard interfaces ?Low life cycle costs 1.2 Increased Safety The CITYFLO 650 solution uses checked redundancy to maintain or improve safety compared to traditional train control equipment.
Inexpensive to install, the CITYFLO 650 solution eliminates wayside equipment due to its simple, reliable contact-less train-to wayside communications systems, thereby permitting shorter, more consistent headways.
The system uses the EBI Com radio block centre which detects trains through the position sent by the radio and controls the EBI Switch point machines.
EBI Link wayside equipment tags are used as norming points to correct position measurement errors.
The EBI Cab onboard ATP ensures that the train does not exceed the permitted speeds or violates the end of a movement authority.
1.3 Automatic Startup?Train Registry System? In traditional CBTC systems, at cold start-up or after a complete shut-down due to failure, the      35 95 8 81 initialization process entails a complete manual sweep of the entire region to clear the blocked segments .
The sweeping is usually performed by technicians by driving the trains manually through all segments in the region.
This is a very time consuming process and can take a few hours for a large metro before restoring the operation.
This is considered as a major weakness in the CBTC systems.
The Train Registry System?TRS?within the CITYFLO 650 solution consists of an independent vital computer that maintains a record of all trains operating within a certain pre-defined area.
This information is communicated to the Automatic Train Protection?ATP?, which then polls and established communication with all the trains in the system.
This obviates the need for any manual sweeping and the auto operation can be resumed within a very short time, usually a few minutes.
1.4 Greater Capacity The Automatic Train Operation?ATO?system fully exploits the capacity of the system as the train travels along the line at a fixed and safe distance from other trains.
The ATO ensures smooth braking and acceleration, resulting in reduced power consumption and wear on the track and vehicles.
The ATO system also provides precision stopping at platforms, automatic door operation and the automatic turnback at the terminal stations.
The system uses the EBI Screen control room to provide the metro operator total overview and control of the traffic.
1.5 Availability CITYFLO 650 provides a fully redundant, ATP and ATO supervised operation to ensure high availability.
The system is also capable to work with a separate fall back capability for metro operation, with manual train operation, in the unlikely event that the fully automated systems are inoperable.
1.6 CITYFLO Monitoring System?CFMS? Another salient feature of the CITYFLO 650 system is its ability to record system data and play back any event that took place in the system.
In case of an incident, the CFMS will ease the identification of the problem and will help to determine the root cause.
In a live railway, CFMS allows identification of the potential problems even before they occur and allow preventive actions in order to improve the availability of the system.
The CFMS tool is also used during the initial system start-up to shorten the development effort and also during factory and field-testing, making it easier and faster to implement and test the CITYFLO 650 system.
1.7 CITYFLO 650: The System of Choice CITYFLO 650 is currently in service at the San Francisco, Seattle-Tacoma?SeaTac?and the Dallas/Fort Worth?DFW?International Airport Automated People Movers.
The system also is working at the South East Pennsylvania Transit Authority?SEPTA?for a steel-wheel LRT tunnel system, albeit in limited operation until all the drivers are trained on the system.
In addition, CITYFLO 650 is currently being implemented at London Heathrow Terminal 5 Automated People Mover?UK?and the Yongin EverLine Automated Rapid Transit?South Korea?.
These projects are currently underway and the systems are scheduled for operation in the next two Jeffrey S.
Stover CITYFLO 650 System Overview 82 to three years.
Most recently, Madrid Metro?Spain?has endorsed the CITYFLO solution as its preferred choice for the ATC upgrade of two of its most important lines, lines 1 and 6, which carry more than 200 million passengers every year.

2.1 Moving Block Concept Unlike the traditional fixed-block systems, in which the train occupancy is generated by occupancy of a fixed-length track circuit?or axle counter?section?referred to as a block?, in a moving-block system, the occupancy of the train moves along with the train in a continuous fashion and that the length of the block deemed occupied by the train also depends on the speed of the train.
2.2 Communication-Based Train Control In a Communications-Based Train Control system, the information controlling the train is transmitted between the train and wayside computers through a radio link, capable of bi-directional transmission.
CITYFLO 650 is a contact-less system, which requires neither track circuits nor an on-board operator to provide a completely automated operation.
2.3 System Architecture Like most modern train control systems, the CITYFLO 650 ATC is divided into various sub-systems, based upon function and modular hardware and software.
The following figure illustrates the Train Control System Architecture for a typical metro installation.
Figure 1: CITYFLO 650 Train Control System Architecture      35 95 8 83 With reference to Figure 1, the CITYFLO 650 is divided into the following distinct elements: Safety Level Subsystem ATS Non-vital Central Control ATO Non-vital ATP Vital Vehicle ATO Vehicle ATP Region ATO Region ATP TWC Non-vital RF Infrastructure 2 1 EBI Screen Automatic Train Supervision?ATS? The ATS is also often called Operational Central Control?OCC?or Central Traffic Control ?CTC?.
The ATS system is the operator interface into the system and control centre functionalities such as: ?Centralized Maintenance System, which uses TCP/IP connection with ethernet for the remote uploading of configuration data ?Transmission of ATP/ATO maintenance data, data logging, archival and report generation ?Manual override requests ?Train initialization ?Management of fleet reductions and build-up?initiation and termination of service Management of train schedules including dwell and headway control?with anti-bunching Management of route assignments for normal operations?train dispatch?and failure modes ?Train management including train or fleet hold, skip station or station close ?Remote set or reset of emergency brakes?assuming safety criteria are satisfied Implementation of failure management strategies ?Other Central Control?CC?functions such as voice communication with the train and supervision ?Control of any power distribution?traction SCADA?system The ATS also provides the interface between the system and the control centre operator?CCO?.
Through audio and visual displays, information will be presented describing the status of the system on a real-time basis.
This information allows the CCO to assess conditions throughout the system and to take appropriate actions.
The CCO is be able to issue commands to initiate and terminate system operations, override selected automatic commands and operations, and perform other system management functions.
The CC subsystem, comprising the CCO and the Supervisor Workstations, are interconnected via the Central Control Network.
The Central Control Network provides the ATS functionality and is connected to the Wayside Network.
The CCO and Supervisor operate / supervise their respective systems from Central.
Additional workstations can be located at the Maintenance area, and can also be connected into the Central Control Network to be used by the maintenance technicians to support the maintenance of the wayside and vehicle ATP/ATO equipment.
The ATS displays provide a windows or menu driven graphical user interface?GUI?that include Status and position of all switches ?Position, route and direction of all communicating trains on the railway network ?Operating mode of all communicating trains on the railway network Jeffrey S.
Stover CITYFLO 650 System Overview 84 ?Displays of system performance and status ?Remote intervention to control and override system operations ?Messages and alarms of abnormal/malfunction conditions ?Status of major vehicle alarms including smoke detectors ?Data recording and reporting Figure 2?Example of Train Control Screen The ATS also includes data loggers to record all operational data.
The data can then be displayed and used for reports as necessary.
This includes any unscheduled stoppages or delays, including time of occurrence and time of resumption of operation complete with the identification number for the train.
In the event that the ATS fails, for example, through a catastrophic failure, the system continues to operate with trains running according to their current schedule and headway regulation, which is controlled by the RATO.
The ATS system monitors and manages the overall system operation.
The ATS is not essential to continuing automatic system operations by the ATO and ATP once operations have been started.
2 2 Automatic Train Control?ATC? The ATC system is divided into two sub-components, wayside and onboard.
The Wayside ATC is divided into a number of regions or geographic areas for each metro line and the number of regions used for a specific line depends on the length of that line and the number of trains on the line.
Often the term Region ATC is used as a general term.
Region ATC refers to a complete set of Region Control equipment which includes, but is not necessarily limited to, Region ATP, Region ATO and TWC Equipment.
Each Region ATC can control several interlockings ?collection of switches or points therefore the ATC equipment may be centralized at one station.
The Region ATP, Region ATO, and remote Region ATP computer systems are responsible for the safe and optimal performance of the CITYFLO 650 Train Control system.
Information flows between these sub-systems through the Wayside Network backbone and through to the Central Control Network.
     35 95 8 85 Each train has two sets of vehicle ATC?VATC?equipment so that redundancy is achieved within each train.
The train location is determined based on tachometer readings from wheel axles or gears.
Due to tolerances in equipment and wheel diameter, positioning errors may accumulate.
Norming points are therefore located along the track to allow the vehicle to reposition itself periodically.
Each norming point is a passive tag that is energized and read by a transponder interrogator mounted on the vehicle as the vehicle passes over.
The ATC components, both wayside and onboard are divided into two sub-systems, provided below.
2 2.1 EBI Cab Automatic Train Protection?ATP? The EBI Cab system is responsible for the safety aspects of the train control system.
The wayside component is referred to as a Region ATP?RATP)and the onboard component as Vehicle ATP?VATP?.
The VATP is responsible for the safe operation of the train including safe train movement and occupancy generation.
In a CITYFLO 650 system, the ATP systems perform the safety critical tasks such as: ?Train Occupancy Detection?RATP and VATP Safe Train Separation?RATP Roll-back Protection and Direction Control?VATP Overspeed Protection?VATP Propulsion and Braking Interlocks?VATP Parted-Train Protection?VATP Switch Interlocking Control?RATP Occupancy Generation?VATP Door Control Enabling and Interlocking?VATP Route setting and interlocking Each Region ATP consists of an independent primary and backup system.
Each primary and backup ATP system interfaces with an independent regional ATO and base data radio.
Each ATP system contains dual-channel, check-redundant processors for safety.
The functions of each ATP system is identical, although the inactive ATP is restricted from exchanging data with the trainborne ATCs and from performing device control until manual switchover occurs.
Manual switchover in the event of failure is provided through an ATS control screen at central.
All wayside device interfaces are brought back to redundant Region ATPs for vital control from either the primary or the backup system.
Either primary or backup can be in an active or standby state depending upon which ATC has control of the system.
Train control, train tracking, and interlocking functions are implemented by the currently active ATC.
2 2.2 EBI Cruise Automatic Train Operation (ATO) The EBI Cruise system is responsible for the non-safety operation of the train control system within the CITYFLO 650.
Similar to the ATP, the ATO system also has both the region and train components the Region ATO?RATO?and the train or Vehicle ATO?VATO?.
Each Region ATC has an independent ATO designated as Region ATO.
The Region ATO performs all non-vital functions related to directing train movement and station operation.
In Jeffrey S.
Stover CITYFLO 650 System Overview 86 support of these functions, the Region ATO is responsible for the generation of various non-vital train movement controls and commands for the respective elements located on the wayside such as: ?Ride Comfort Control, e jerk limiting?VATO Stopping accuracy?VATO Train operation according to commanded speed profile?acceleration and deceleration?, including performance levels, e coasting, energy saving etc?VATO Door Control Requests?RATO and VATO Onboard triggers for audio announcements and dynamic displays?VATO Wayside Passenger Announcement triggers to platform display systems?RATO? System status and control data associated with each Region ATO are processed and sent to the Central Control System where the current status of the system is displayed.
The Region ATO units are also operationally redundant with a Master and Standby unit.
Each independent primary and backup ATO system operates in conjunction with the Region ATP primary and backup systems.
Both the primary and backup Region ATO collect data from their own region, but only the primary system issues commands and requests.
To display the proper sign and announcement at each station, the Region ATO monitors the location of the train as it approaches a station.
Once the train has stopped at a station, the Region ATO monitors the dwell of the train to trigger the relevant station sign and announcement.
The Region ATOs message identifies to the Passenger Information System the specific station sign to be displayed and the specific announcement to play.
Besides station control, the Region ATO computer is also responsible for reading all the vehicle tag readers that verify a train s consist during initialization.
Because the transition areas are distributed throughout the system, an RS-485 serial network or Ethernet is used to connect the Region ATO to the vehicle tag readers.
When a particular transition area becomes activated and after verifying the data received from the vehicle tag readers, the Region ATO passes the train initialization information to the Region ATP.
The Region ATP communicates with the Vehicle ATP to complete the initialization process.
The Region ATO interfaces with the Region ATP computer via the Wayside Network.
It also sends and receives vehicle messages from the Vehicle ATO through the Region ATP.
The Region ATO interfaces with the Central Control System via the Wayside Network 2 3 Train to Wayside?TWC?Communications System Communication between the trains and wayside for train control is provided by the Train to Wayside Communications?TWC?subsystem.
The TWC is a radio frequency?RF?subsystem that uses a Spread Spectrum Code Division Multiple Access?CDMA?modulation technique at 2.4 GHz.
The RF communications uses either a leaky coaxial cable or Line of Sight?LOS?antenna network along the wayside that transmits data to the trains via their onboard mobile antennas.
The trains and regions communicate through the TWC link every COMM Cycle.
The trainborne ATC continuously receives messages from the wayside ATC as long as the communication link is maintained.
When a train loses communications, the wayside ATC creates a protection block around the lost-communication train and, at the same time, the trainborne ATC equipment applies the service brakes.
Upon restoring the communication, the wayside ATC removes the blocks associated with losing communication with that train.
     35 95 8 87 The TWC not only supports the transfer of train control data between trains and wayside but also supports the two-way transfer of ATP/ATO maintenance data between the trains and the Centralized Maintenance Office.
The radio connection is achieved through the use of base data radios?BDRs?and mobile data radios?MDRs?.
These spread spectrum radios have been designed to meet the unique demands of CBTC systems.
The BDR and MDR operate at 2.4-GHz to 2.4835-GHz.
This can also be adapted to suit specific requirements or standards associated with non-licensed low power transmission in the 2.4GHz or higher frequency bands per the national legislation adopted within the ITU recommendations.
The RF-to-fiber conversion units, EoCell , are used to distribute the radio signal to wayside-mounted leaky coaxial cable or LOS antennas.
The EoCell devices have no oscillators, and are therefore not an intentional emitter.
The power levels into the wayside leaky coaxial cable or LOS antennas are adjustable at the remote EoCell equipment.
A Base Data Radio?BDR?is co-located with each Region ATP?one for the Master and one for the Standby.
Each BDR?both primary and standby?feeds into a switch and then to a pair of RF-to-Fiber Master converters?A B?.
These fan out?in a star arrangement?to Remote RF-to-Fiber Cells or amplifiers along that Region.
The RF system operates in full-duplex mode.
Master A communicates through every odd cell?e A1, A2, A3 etc.?, and Master B communicates through even cells?B1, B2, B3 etc Each leaky coaxial cable segment is terminated by an odd cell and an even cell; therefore if one of the Masters or cells fails, then radio coverage is maintained.
The following figure shows the architecture for the RF distribution network.
Figure 3: CITYFLO 650 Radio Data Transmission System Architecture?1 region shown? The Region ATP is responsible for formatting all data to be transmitted to the trains.
It receives information from the Central Control through the Region ATO and transmits that data along with Jeffrey S.
Stover CITYFLO 650 System Overview 88 data of its own to the trains.
The TWC equipment includes the Radiax, BDR, Distribution Amplifiers?not shown on the overview in Fogure 1?, Mobile Antennas?on board the trains?, and the MDR?Mobile Data Radio on board the trains?.
Data is transferred through the MDR to and from the Vehicle ATP?VATP?.
Note that Line of Sight antennae can be used instead of the Radiax to provide RF distribution; the decision to use one system or the other is determined during the design process based on the application and specific site / customer requirements.
3?CITYFLO 650, Special Concepts / Features CITYFLO 650 is a true Moving-Block system and there are several concepts and features, unique to the CITYFLO 650 system, that differentiate it from the other DTO/UTO systems available.
3.1 The CITYFLO 650 Segment and the Modelling of the Track In Communication-Based Train Control, MovingBlock systems, as well as in all contactless train control systems, there are no track circuits to provide information to the trains or occupancy from the trains.
CITYFLO 650 models the tracks using the entity called a CITYFLO Segment , which is defined to be a section of track that is defined by a set of unique values in: ?Grade ?Speed ?Platform Location ?Switch Location ?Region Boundary ?End of Line ?Emergency Walkway Location ?Underlying Fixed Block Locations The following figure provides an example of the segment layout of a simple CITYFLO system.
Figure 4?Typical CITYFLO Segment Layout      35 95 8 89 Each segment has a name associated with it that includes its Region Number and Segment Number?within that Region?.
The segment layout provides for the determination of location which is handled through what is called the Moving Block Coordinate System ?MBCS?, which defines the location of by a Region Number, Segment Number, and Offset into that segment.
For example, suppose that a train was 25% through segment R1S4 which is, say, 100 m long, then the location of the train in MBCS is R1, S4, O25; for Region 1, Segment 4, and Offset 25.
3.2 Norming Points A Norming Point is a Passive Device or Passive Tag containing location data .
These tags are situated along the track and contain their own location data in the form of the MBCS.
When a train passes over a tag, the tag is energized by the RF energy from the train s tag reader antenna.
The tag in turn transmits its location to the train.
The tag location is used by the train for two important elements within its train control system: 1.
Verification of the train s location 2.
Normalizing the train s positioning error?discussed below in detail? As the train travels along its route it incurs a Norming Point.
The train reads the location information embedded within the Norming Point Tag and verifies the tag location with its calculated location.
The second purpose for which Norming Points are used is the re-normalization of the train s accrued position error.
As the train moves along its route, it continuously calculates its location using its onboard positioning system.
This system is made up of tachometers that have an associated error.
This error is accrued as the train continues its movement along its route.
The Train Control System places a maximum on this position error accrual and the Norming Points are used to reset this positioning error to a minimum.
The following figure illustrates the error accrual and normalisation.
Figure 5?Position Error Accrual Mitigation In the event of a faulty or missing norming point, the train just continues past that point without having normalized its error until the next norming point where the error is finally normalized.
This usually does not have any influence on the operation or on the headway.
3.3 Conflict Points Jeffrey S.
Stover CITYFLO 650 System Overview 90 A Conflict Point is defined as the end of movement authority, i the location along the track beyond which is a train is not permitted.
The Region ATP uses these Conflict Points to properly and safely manage the movement of trains throughout the railway network.
Typical Conflict Points include Rear of Train in Front, End of Line, A point not set or End of route for a particular train.
3.4 Train Occupancy in CITYFLO 650 In moving-block systems, train occupancy is generated by the train and sent back to the wayside control system.
This train generated occupancy is based upon the worst-case braking of the train.
The trainborne ATC is responsible for calculating the location and occupancy of the train.
The trainborne ATC generates the train s occupancy using the worst-case stopping distance and transmits this virtual occupancy to the wayside ATC.
The trainborne ATC is programmed with the worst-case performance parameters of the propulsion and braking systems and uses these parameters to calculate the worst-case braking distances.
During each task cycle, the emergency braking distance is calculated for a final speed of zero and also for final speeds of the lesser of each segment s civil or restricted speed limit in the train s route.
These emergency braking distances are compared to three different distances: 1.
The distance from the train s head footprint to the front conflict point 2.
The distance from the train s head footprint to the service braking distance?the service brake conflict point? 3.
For each segment in the train s route, the distance required to slow the train to that route segment s line speed limit if it is lower than the current segment s line speed limit If any of these three distances are less than the associated emergency braking distance or if one of the safety restrictions requiring emergency braking is violated, then the emergency brakes are applied.
Otherwise, if all three of the above distances are greater than the associated emergency braking distance, then the service braking distance is used.
The service brakes are not applied, unless one of the safety restrictions requiring service braking is violated or until the train enters its service braking distance?i , its service brake stopping profile?.
The service braking distance is the braking distance that is applied when coming to a normal stop utilizing the service braking rate.
The service braking calculation is based on ride comfort and is therefore a jerk-limited, acceleration-bounded braking scheme.
The service braking distance is calculated for the purpose of determining the distance required to allow the trainborne ATO to stop the train at a comfortable rate to prevent the trainborne ATP from having to initiate an emergency brake stop.
